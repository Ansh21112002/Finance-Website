            <h2>NOW LETS SEE ABOUT MONEY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES..</h2><br>
            <h3>1.Creating a budget </h3>
            <p> It is extremely important and it is something that you should start doing right away. The key to
                budgeting is identifying the difference between wants and needs. Begin by listing monthly income,
                savings, and any parental allowances. <br><br>

                Next, write down your estimated expenses for the month. Take things into account like books, school
                supplies, laundry, food outside your meal plan, and personal care items to make sure you’re painting an
                accurate picture of your spending habits. <br><br>

                Of course, creating a budget does not mean that you can’t have fun. Take your “fun” expenses into
                account when creating your budget. Setting these limits ahead of time will put you on the right path to
                better money management in the future. <br><br>
            </p><br>
            <h3>2.Be smart about credit cards</h3>
            <p>College is an amazing time to start building credit. However, it can be easy to get caught up in debt if
                you’re not careful. Make sure to choose the right credit card for you. Create a pros/cons list for the
                different options you are offered and set a reasonably low spending limit for yourself.
                <br>
                Do your research to determine the card that is right for you, though benefits like points and cash back
                rewards are attractive to many.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>
                3.Find cheap housing
            </h3>
            <p>Housing is a large and unavoidable cost in college. If you do not have the luxury of living at home,
                check out what your campus has to offer. See our article about saving money on housing as a student.
                <br>
                Living on campus your first year or two of college is a cost-effective way to get that full college
                experience. Renting is also a practical way to save money in college. Be proactive about building your
                credit and use services that report rent payments to credit bureaus.
                <br>
                If you are not familiar with the area, chat with other students to learn about the different options
                available. One of them might be moving out of a place that would be perfect for you.
                <br>
                Living with roommates is also a major money saver when it comes to housing. Chat with people at
                orientation or who are in the same classes as you to see if they also need a place to live. Who knows,
                you could end up meeting some of your best friends!

            <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets
            </h1><br>
            <h2>Definition</h2><br>
            <p>Ever heard the phrase “Tom is an asset to the company”? The meaning is clear. Tom is a good worker that
                brings value to the organization.
                an asset is anything of value or a resource of value that can be converted into cash. Individuals,
                companies, and governments own assets. For a company, an asset might generate revenue, or a company
                might benefit in some way from owning or using the asset.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Personal Assets</h2><br>
            <p>Personal assets are things of present or future value owned by an individual or household. Common
                examples of personal assets include:
                Cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, checking, and savings accounts, money market
                accounts, physical cash, Treasury bills
                Property or land and any structure that is permanently attached to it.<br>
                <br>
            <h3>Personal property –</h3> boats, collectibles, household furnishings, jewelry, vehicles<br>
            <br>
            <h3>Investments –</h3> annuities, bonds, the cash value of life insurance policies, mutual funds, pensions,
            retirement plans, stocks.
            Your net worth is calculated by subtracting your liabilities from your assets. Essentially, your assets are
            everything you own, and your liabilities are everything you owe. A positive net worth indicates that your
            assets are greater in value than your liabilities; a negative net worth signifies that your liabilities
            exceed your assets (in other words, you are in debt).<br>

            <br>
            <h2>Business Assets</h2><br>
            <p>For companies, assets are things of value that sustain production and growth. For a business, assets can
                include machines, property, raw materials and inventory - as well as intangibles such as patents,
                royalties, and other intellectual property.

                The balance sheet lists a company's assets and shows how those assets are financed, whether through debt
                or through issuing equity. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of how well a company's management is
                using its resources.
            </p>
            <p>There are two types of assets on a typical balance sheet:</p><br>
            <h3>Current Assets </h3><br>
            <p>Current Assets are assets that can be converted into cash within one fiscal year or one operating cycle.
                Current assets are used to facilitate day-to-day operational expenses and investments.

                Examples of current assets include:

            <h4>Cash and cash equivalents: </h4>Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and cash
            Marketable securities: Debt securities or equity that is liquid
            <h4>Accounts receivables:</h4> Money owed by customers to be paid in the short-term
            Inventory: Goods available for sale or raw materials

            </p><br>
            <h3>Fixed Assets</h3>
            <p>Fixed assets are non-current assets that a company uses in its production or goods, and services that
                have a life of more than one year. Fixed assets are recorded on the balance sheet and listed as
                property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). Fixed assets are long-term assets and are referred to as tangible
                assets, meaning they can be physically touched.

            <ul>Examples of fixed assets include: </ul>

            <ul>Vehicles (such as company trucks)</ul>
            <ul>Office furniture</ul>
            <ul>Machinery</ul>
            <ul>Buildings</ul>
            <ul>Land</ul>
