            <h2>What are Banks?</h2><br>
            <p>Banks are financial institutions licensed to store our money and provide security.There are different
                types of banks, we will study them in detail later.
                these institutions give you various financial supports such as
                accounts,Loans,credit,mortagages,insurances and much more.
                These concepts are very large and complex in themselves.
                But How do the Banks earn?
                They take service charges from us and also through interests on loans.
                Although banks provide an interest on our savings account, they take much more interest on loans so the
                calculations are always positive.
                EXAMPLE: lets say a bank XYZ gives us 1% interest on whatever the amount we have put in our savings
                account. At the same time it takes 6% interest from whoever is taking loans. And if you see the business
                cycles almost every business takes loans from the banks to expand their business, so the people taking
                loans are not less.
            </p>
            <p>A credit card allows you to make purchases and pay for them later. In that sense, it's like a short-term
                loan.</p><br>
            <h2>Prepaid Cards:</h2>
            <p>Some of the financial services given by banks are as follows:
            <ol>Products:</ol>
            <ol>Cards</ol>
            <ol>Deposits</ol>
            <ol>Loan</ol>
            <ol>FASTAG</ol>
            <ol>Invest</ol>
            <ol>Insurances</ol>
            </p><br>
            <h2>Credit cards:</h2>
            <p>A credit card allows you to make purchases and pay for them later. In that sense, it's like a short-term
                loan.if you purchase a 2000 ₹ shirt through your credit card,what exactly happens is the bank is paying
                for you. But you have to return the amount later to the bank. Now here also the banks are earning.
                Actually the banks don't pay whole 2000₹,it cuts 1%(for example) amount and then pays the remaining. So
                the receiver(shopkeeper) gets only 1980 ₹.

                any merchant that accepts its payment network, such as Visa or Mastercard.</p><br>
            <h2>Forex cards:</h2>
            <p>foreign-exchange cards let you to load multiple currencies in it.so that when you go on a trip covering
                America and dubai then you can load dollars and dirhams in your same forex card.</p><br>
            <h2>Savings account:</h2>

                reliability makes it better option to keep money in.</p><br>
            <h2>Current account:</h2>
            <p>it is for businesses. A businessman has higher number of regular transactions. Unlike savings account
                transactions can be made anytime and without any limit.</p><br>
            <h2>Salary Accounts</h2>
            <p>if you are on a job then your salary will be credited to you in salary account. Internal working and
                networks of salary account are different from savings and current accounts.</p><br>
            <h2>Recurring deposits:</h2>
            <p>A recurring deposit is a special kind of term deposit offered by banks which help people with regular
                incomes to deposit a fixed amount every month into their recurring deposit account and earn interest at
                the rate applicable to fixed deposits.</p><br>

            <p>Fixed deposits are a high-interest-yielding term deposit and offered by banks in India. Investing in a
                fixed deposit earns customers a higher interest rate than depositing money in a saving account.</p><br>
