            <p>a few years back, blogging was just another hobby that some people did in addition to working full-time

            <h2>NOW LETS SEE ABOUT MONEY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES..</h2>
            <h3>1.Creating a budget </h3>
            <p>It is extremely important and it is something that you should start doing right away. The key to
                budgeting is identifying the difference between wants and needs. Begin by listing monthly income,
                savings, and any parental allowances. </p><br><br>

            Next, write down your estimated expenses for the month. Take things into account like books, school
            supplies, laundry, food outside your meal plan, and personal care items to make sure you’re painting an
            accurate picture of your spending habits. <br><br>

            Of course, creating a budget does not mean that you can’t have fun. Take your “fun” expenses into account
            when creating your budget. Setting these limits ahead of time will put you on the right path to better money
            management in the future. <br><br>
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>2.Be smart about credit cards</h3>
            <p>College is an amazing time to start building credit. However, it can be easy to get caught up in debt if
                you’re not careful. Make sure to choose the right credit card for you. Create a pros/cons list for the
                different options you are offered and set a reasonably low spending limit for yourself.
                <br>
                Do your research to determine the card that is right for you, though benefits like points and cash back
                rewards are attractive to many.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>
                3.Find cheap housing
            </h3>
            <p>Housing is a large and unavoidable cost in college. If you do not have the luxury of living at home,
                check out what your campus has to offer. See our article about saving money on housing as a student.
                <br>
                Living on campus your first year or two of college is a cost-effective way to get that full college
                experience. Renting is also a practical way to save money in college. Be proactive about building your
                credit and use services that report rent payments to credit bureaus.
                <br>
                If you are not familiar with the area, chat with other students to learn about the different options
                available. One of them might be moving out of a place that would be perfect for you.
                <br>
                Living with roommates is also a major money saver when it comes to housing. Chat with people at
                orientation or who are in the same classes as you to see if they also need a place to live. Who knows,
                you could end up meeting some of your best friends!
