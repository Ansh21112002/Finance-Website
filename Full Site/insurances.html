            <h2>Definitions</h2><br>
            <p>Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used
                to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.
                An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, an insurance company, an insurance carrier or
                an underwriter.A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The
                insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known - relatively small - loss in
                the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in
                the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial
                terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by
                ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.</p><br>
            <h2>How Insurance Works:</h2><br>
            <p>The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and
                circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the
                insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. If
                the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits
                a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster. A mandatory out-of-pocket expense required
                by an insurance policy before an insurer will pay a claim is called a deductible. The insurer may hedge
                its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the
                risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.</p><br>
            <h2>History Of Insurance:</h2><br>
            <p>Insurance became far more sophisticated in Enlightenment era Europe, where specialized varieties
                developed.

                Lloyd's Coffee House was the first organized market for marine insurance.
                Property insurance as we know it today can be traced to the Great Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured
                more than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance
                "from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in Sir Christopher
                Wren's inclusion of a site for "the Insurance Office" in his new plan for London in 1667." A number of
                attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681, economist Nicholas Barbon and eleven
                associates established the first fire insurance company, the "Insurance Office for Houses", at the back
                of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes. Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by his
                Insurance Office.
                At the same time, the first insurance schemes for the underwriting of business ventures became
                available. By the end of the seventeenth century, London's growth as a centre for trade was increasing
                due to the demand for marine insurance. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd opened a coffee house, which
                became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships,
                including those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led to the establishment
                of the insurance market Lloyd's of London and several related shipping and insurance businesses.

                The first life insurance policies were taken out in the early 18th century. The first company to offer
                life insurance was the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, founded in London in 1706 by
                William Talbot and Sir Thomas Allen. Upon the same principle, Edward Rowe Mores established the Society
                for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship in 1762.
                It was the world's first mutual insurer and it pioneered age based premiums based on mortality rate
                laying "the framework for scientific insurance practice and development" and "the basis of modern life
                assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently based."
                In the late 19th century "accident insurance" began to become available. The first company to offer
                accident insurance was the Railway Passengers Assurance Company, formed in 1848 in England to insure
                against the rising number of fatalities on the nascent railway system.
                By the late 19th century governments began to initiate national insurance programs against sickness and
                old age. Germany built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as
                in the 1840s. In the 1880s Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced old age pensions, accident insurance
                and medical care that formed the basis for Germany's welfare state.In Britain more extensive legislation
                was introduced by the Liberal government in the 1911 National Insurance Act. This gave the British
                working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. This system
                was greatly expanded after the Second World War under the influence of the Beveridge Report, to form the
                first modern welfare state.</p>

            <p>Insurance involves pooling funds from many insured entities (known as exposures) to pay for the losses
                that some may incur. The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee
                being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an insurable
                risk, the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a financial intermediary
                is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry, but individual entities
                can also self-insure through saving money for possible future losses.
                Risk which can be insured by private companies typically share seven common characteristics:[19]
                Large number of similar exposure units: Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority
                of insurance policies cover individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the
                law of large numbers in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include
                Lloyd's of London, which is famous for ensuring the life or health of actors, sports figures, and other
                famous individuals. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different
                premium rates.
                Definite loss: This type of loss takes place at a known time and place, and from a known cause. The
                classic example involves the death of an insured person on a life-insurance policy. Fire, automobile
                accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be
                definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious
                conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause
                of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could
                objectively verify all three elements.
                Accidental loss: The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least
                outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be pure, in the sense that it
                results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative
                elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a lottery ticket are generally not
                considered insurable.
                Large loss: The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance
                premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the
                policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be
                able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected
                cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real
                value to a buyer.
                Affordable premium: If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large,
                that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, then it is not likely
                that insurance will be purchased, even if on offer. Furthermore, as the accounting profession formally
                recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a
                reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance of loss, then the
                transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance (see the U.S. Financial Accounting
                Standards Board pronouncement number 113: "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration
                and Long-Duration Contracts").
                Calculable loss: There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the
                probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise,
                while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the
                insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a
                reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the
                claim.
                Limited risk of catastrophically large losses: Insurable losses are ideally independent and
                non-catastrophic, meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe
                enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single
                event to some small portion of their capital base. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell
                earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the United States, the federal
                government insures flood risk. In commercial fire insurance, it is possible to find single properties
                whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such
                properties are generally shared among several insurers or are insured by a single insurer which
                syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market.

            <h2>Legal</h2><br>
            <p>When a company insures an individual entity, there are basic legal requirements and regulations. Several
                commonly cited legal principles of insurance include:[20]
                Indemnity – the insurance company indemnifies or compensates, the insured in the case of certain losses
                only up to the insured's interest.
                Benefit insurance – as it is stated in the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, the
                insurance company does not have the right of recovery from the party who caused the injury and is to
                compensate the Insured regardless of the fact that Insured had already sued the negligent party for the
                damages (for example, personal accident insurance)
                Insurable interest – the insured typically must directly suffer from the loss. Insurable interest must
                exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved. The concept requires that the
                insured have a "stake" in the loss or damage to the life or property insured. What that "stake" is will
                be determined by the kind of insurance involved and the nature of the property ownership or relationship
                between the persons. The requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes insurance from
                gambling.
                Utmost good faith – (Uberrima fides) the insured and the insurer are bound by a good faith bond of
                honesty and fairness. Material facts must be disclosed.
                Contribution – insurers which have similar obligations to the insured contribute in the indemnification,
                according to some method.
                Subrogation – the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue recoveries on behalf of the insured;
                for example, the insurer may sue those liable for the insured's loss. The Insurers can waive their
                subrogation rights by using the special clauses.
                Causa proxima, or proximate cause – the cause of loss (the peril) must be covered under the insuring
                agreement of the policy, and the dominant cause must not be excluded
                Mitigation – In case of any loss or casualty, the asset owner must attempt to keep loss to a minimum, as
                if the asset was not insured.


                To "indemnify" means to make whole again, or to be reinstated to the position that one was in, to the
                extent possible, prior to the happening of a specified event or peril. Accordingly, life insurance is
                generally not considered to be indemnity insurance, but rather "contingent" insurance (i.e., a claim
                arises on the occurrence of a specified event). There are generally three types of insurance contracts
                that seek to indemnify an insured:
                A "reimbursement" policy
                A "pay on behalf" or "on behalf of policy"[21]
                An "indemnification" policy

                Insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of
                losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals
                prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.
                Insurance can influence the probability of losses through moral hazard, insurance fraud, and preventive
                steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically used moral hazard to refer to the
                increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to
                intentional carelessness or indifference.[25] Insurers attempt to address carelessness through
                inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss
                mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some
                commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss
                control measures—particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes—because of concerns over
                rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active
                role in loss mitigation, such as through building codes.</p><br>
            <h2>Methods of insurance</h2><br>
            <p>According to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance
                as follows:
                Co-insurance – risks shared between insurers
                Dual insurance – having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk (both the individual
                policies would not pay separately – under a concept named contribution, they would contribute together
                to make up the policyholder's losses. However, in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance,
                dual payment is allowed)
                Self-insurance – situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by
                the entities or individuals themselves
                Reinsurance – situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer, called
                the reinsurer
