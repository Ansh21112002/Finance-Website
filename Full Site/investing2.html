            <p>To invest is to allocate money with the expectation of a positive benefit/return in the future. In other
                words, to invest means owning an asset or an item with the goal of generating income from the investment
                which is an increase in the value of the asset over a period of time. When you invest it always requires
                a sacrifice of some present asset that you own today such as time, money, or effort.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>HOW TO INVEST?</h2><br>
            <p>Before we start our dream of investments it would be better for you to note that while investing you can
                come across a big/small loss anytime,anywhere,for any reason.
                An investor always bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested.
                Basically to invest, it requires a sacrifice of some present asset you own today such as time, money,
                effort, etc..
                For example, lets say we want to start a business. Obviously it requires a capital investment,but at the
                same time it requires lot of your time and effort which is much more worthy than your capital.<br>

            <h3>DICTIONARY: 1.what is capital investment? 2.worth and value. 3. What is asset??</h3><br>
            <p>Keep in mind that you should invest only that much money which You can afford as a loss.
                While investing you can have some basic rules to avoid getting slammed.
                diversify your portfolio
                keep your risk tolerance capacity in mind
                don't let emotions control your actions.
                Dont panic on losses,learn to convert them into money</p><br>
            <h3>DICTIONARY: 1. What is a portfolio?</h3><br>

            <p>DID YOU KNOW?
                You can have a “foreign currency savings account” in which you can keep currency other than rupees.
                Investors use this type of account to invest in currency other than rupees.
                HOW DOES IT WORK?
                Let's take an example:
                Let's say for now 1 $ = 70 ₹. I exchanged 700 ₹ for 10 $ and saved it into my foreign currency savings
                account. Now after many days and many changes in the values of both the currencies I see that today 1$ =
                50₹. Note that the relative value of $ decreased with respect to ₹.Now this means that if I convert my
                10$ back into ₹ then i will only get 500 ₹. Ohh Noo!! I am in loss of 200₹. cool down it was just and
                example.Cases can be different if you invest carefully and consciously.
                So the risk in foreign currency exchanges is that whatever currency you have invested in may go down in
                valuation due to international/national/government/pandemic/riots reasons.</p><br>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>WHERE TO INVEST?</h2><br>
            <p>There are literally many sectors to invest in.viz. Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, FDs, Real Estate,
                Commodities, Cryptocurrencies and hell lot more ways.
                One more thing that you should learn before putting your money is the Return on investment.

            <h3>Return on investment:</h3>
            In finance, return is a profit on an investment.[1] It comprises any change in value of the investment,
            and/or cash flows which the investor receives from that investment, such as interest payments, coupons, cash
            dividends, stock dividends. It may be measured either in absolute terms (e.g., rupees) or as a percentage of
            the amount invested. The latter is also called the holding period return.
            A loss instead of a profit is described as a negative return, assuming the amount invested is greater than
            zero.
            We can study the terms one by one
            <ul>
                <h4>Interest payments:</h4> Have you ever heard about the interest rate given by banks on the amount of
                money we have in savings accounts or fixed deposits? The bank gives us interest on the money which we
                keep in our account, although the percentage may vary from bank to bank and also from account to
                account.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h4>Coupons:</h4> It is the same as discount coupons given by a shopping mart. Reliance Jio may give a
                1000 ₹ discount coupon on Jio Mart to its investors.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h4>Cash dividends:</h4> we just entered the stock market. A company gives its investors a part of its
                annual profits. how much u get is decided by how many stocks you have currently.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h4>stock dividend:</h4> same concept as Cash dividend; only difference is that instead of money the
                company gives more stocks to its investors.How much u get is proportional to how much you hold.
            </ul>
            </p><br>
            <h2>Following are the sectors in which you can invest : </h2><br>
            <h3>Direct Equity :</h3>
            <p>It's the stock market.
                Equity is the partnership units of a company. So if you say that you have 1 share of XYZ company that
                means that you are also an owner of the company but only of one share,mind it. More number of shares
                means more partnership in the company. So that’s why the owner of the company has more than 51% of the
                shares on his name.
                if somehow another person gets hold on 51% or more shares then that person will be the new owner of the
                company(IMAGINE).
                To directly invest in equity, one needs to open a “demat account''.
                DICTIONARY: 1. What is a demat account?
            </p>
            <h3>Equity mutual funds:</h3>
            <p>Equity mutual fund schemes predominantly invest in equity stocks.Typically, equity funds are known to
                generate better returns than term deposits or debt-based funds.But as the returns are high so is the
                risk.Basically You give your money to a firm to invest, and they assure you to give profits.You can
                select from different schemes like in a particular sector, in under-performing companies or based on
                market capitalization like companies having high market capitals or invest 65% in large cap companies
                and remaining in small cap and mid cap.
                Advantages of investing in Equity mutual funds:
            <ul>your money is managed by the experts.</ul>
            <ul>it is convenient</ul>
            <ul>offers diversification</ul>
            <ul>offers flexibility</ul>
            When you decide to invest, apart from other choices, a big question faced by you is choosing between a lump
            sum and SIP investment plan.
            Lumpsum investment means that you invest the entire amount together. For example, if you want to buy units
            worth Rs. 5 lakh, then you can debit your bank account by the said amount and purchase the units. On the
            other hand, an SIP or Systematic Investment Plan means that you invest a fixed amount of money at regular
            intervals.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Debt mutual funds:</h3>
            <p>Debt mutual fund schemes are suitable for investors who want steady returns.Debt funds aim to generate
                returns for investors by investing their money in avenues like bonds and other fixed-income securities.
                They are less volatile and, hence, considered less risky compared to equity funds.
            <ul>Advantages of debt mutual funds:
                <ul>Low risk</ul>
                <ul>Stability(Fixed income)</ul>
                <ul>Tax efficiency - governments do not put taxes on the returns of debt mutual funds until the returns
                    exceed a set limit(inflation rate). That’s why many investors use this to reduce their annual tax
                    outgo.</ul>
                <ul>flexibility - it allows you to move your money to different funds.</ul>
                </p><br>
                <h3>Public provident fund(PPF):</h3>
                <p>Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a long term investment option that offers an attractive rate of
                    interest and returns on the amount invested. The interest earned and the returns are not taxable
                    under Income Tax.
                    A PPF account can be opened with either a Post Office or with any nationalised bank like the State
                    Bank of India or Punjab National Bank, etc. These days, even certain private banks like ICICI, HDFC
                    and Axis Bank among others are authorized to provide this facility.
                    Who can invest in PPF?
                <ul>Any Indian citizen can invest in PPF.</ul>
                <ul>One citizen can have only one PPF account unless the second account is in the name of a minor.</ul>
                <ul>NRIs and HUFs are not eligible to open a PPF account.</ul>
                Since the PPF has a long tenure of 15 years, the impact of compounding of tax-free interest is huge,
                especially in the later years.
                As a rule, one can fully withdraw the PPF account balance only upon maturity i.e. after the completion
                of 15 years. Upon completion of 15 years, the entire amount standing to the credit of an account holder
                in the PPF account along with the accrued interest can be withdrawn freely and the account can be
                closed.
                However, if account holders are in need of funds, and wish to withdraw before 15 years, the scheme
                permits partial withdrawals from year 7 i.e. on completing 6 years. An account holder can withdraw
                prematurely, up to a maximum of 50% of the amount that is in the account at the end of the 4th year
                (preceding the year in which the amount is withdrawn or at the end of the preceding year, whichever is
                lower). Further, withdrawals can be made only once in a financial year.
                </p><br>
                <h3>Bank fixed deposits(FD):</h3>
                <p>Fixed deposit accounts are an investment instrument offered by banks and other financial
                    institutions. Under this account, investors would deposit a lump sum over a period. In return, they
                    would get a fixed rate of interest throughout the investment tenure. The rate of interest provided
                    on FDs is much higher than that of a regular savings bank account. Once the tenure of the deposit
                    ends, investors can withdraw their investment. On the other hand, they have a choice of reinvesting
                    their money for another term
                    A bank fixed deposit is considered a comparatively safer (than equity or mutual funds) choice for
                    investing in India. Under the deposit insurance and credit guarantee corporation (DICGC) rules, each
                    depositor in a bank is insured up to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh with effect from February 4, 2020 for
                    both principal and interest amount.
                    Fixed deposit accounts can be distinguished into several categories based on the benefits offered by
                    the account, the account holder type, and the purpose for which the account is opened. Here, we have
                    listed down some types of FD accounts:</p><br>
                <p>
                <h4>1.Regular FD Account:</h4>The regular FD account is for individuals who are aged less than 60 years.
                The interest rates for such an FD account will be lesser than the one offered for senior citizens. Any
                Indian resident individual can open this account.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>2.FD Account for Senior Citizens:</h4>This account is dedicated to senior citizens, i.e. individuals
                aged above 60 years. Such account holders get a higher interest rate than usual and can access the
                monthly interest payout option, which can be thought of as a means for the monthly expenses for senior
                citizens.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>3.Corporate FD Account:</h4>Corporate firms get a separate set of interest rates and deposit tenures
                with banks. Firms can deposit the excess funding or profits they have raised in such corporate FD
                accounts for the time being until they put the cash in use.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>4.Tax-Saving FD Account:</h4>Many risk-averse individuals utilise the tax-saving FD accounts with a
                minimum lock-in period of five years to save income tax. Such deposits gain tax deduction under section
                80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>5.NRO FD Account:</h4>Non-Resident Ordinary FD account can be opened by Overseas Citizen of India
                (OCI), Person of Indian Origin (PIO), and Non-Resident Indian (NRI). Any income earned in INR can be
                deposited only in NRO FD accounts. This account can be jointly held with an Indian resident as long as
                this person falls in one of the categories of relatives specified under Section 6 of the Companies Act,
                1956.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>6.NRE FD Account:</h4>A Non-Resident External (NRE) FD account can be opened by two or more NRIs.
                The account acts as the right way to convert the foreign currency earned outside India into Indian
                currency denominations. Both the principal and interest from this account are completely repatriable.
                The interest income from this account is exempted from tax under Section 10(4) of the Income Tax Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>7.FCNR FD Account:</h4>Foreign Currency Non-Repatriable FD account can be opened by NRIs and can
                deposit money earned overseas in India. The currencies generally accepted are US Dollars, Pounds
                Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, etc. The account allows you to retain your money in the same currency
                while earning good returns.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>8.FD Account With Monthly Payout:</h4>These FD accounts payout interest accumulated on a monthly
                basis. That is the interest accrued will not be added back to the principal, and the interest will not
                be compounded in this case. You can choose to get the interest component sent to your savings account on
                a monthly basis and utilise the sum for any expenses.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>9.FD Account With Maturity Payout:</h4>In this case, the interest gets accrued in the FD account
                over the deposit tenure, gets compounded, and you will receive the principal + interest components upon
                maturity of the FD account.</p><br>

            <h3> Real estate:</h3><br>
            <p>Real estate is property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural resources such
                as crops, minerals or water; immovable property of this nature.
                Residential real estate may contain either a single family or multifamily structure that is available
                for occupation or for non-business purposes.
                In markets where land and building prices are rising, real estate is often purchased as an investment,
                whether or not the owner intends to use the property. Often the Real estate residential properties are
                rented but some investors prefer “flipping”. Flipping means to trade in real estate; buying and selling
                the property in a short time. This may be done to take advantage of rising values or sudden rise in
                values of Real estate.Sometimes Repair and modification work is done to increase the value of the
                property.
                The house that you live in is for self-consumption and should never be considered as an investment. If
                you do not intend to live in it, the second property you buy can be your investment. Investments in real
                estate deliver returns in two ways - capital appreciation and rentals.
                Capital appreciation means that the property which you buy today for 50 lakhs will be 70 lakhs after 10
                years. So the value of your capital increased.
                rent means to give your property on rent to another guy who will pay you for using your property.</p>
            <h3>Gold:</h3><br>
            <p>Possessing gold in the form of jewellery has its own concerns such as safety and high cost. Many banks
                sell gold coins now-a-days. Investment in paper gold is more cost-effective and can be done through gold
                ETFs. Investing in Sovereign Gold Bonds is another option to own paper-gold. An investor can also invest
                via gold mutual funds.
                You can also invest directly in gold in commodities markets(works similar to stock market).
            </p><br>
            <h3>RBI taxable bonds:</h3><br>
            <p>Earlier, RBI used to issue 7.75% Savings (Taxable) Bonds as an investment option. However, the central
                bank has stopped issuing these bonds with effect from May 29, 2020. These bonds were launched by
                replacing the 8% Savings (Taxable) Bonds 2003 with the 7.75 %Savings (Taxable) Bonds with effect from
                January 10, 2018. These bonds had a tenure of 7 years.

                The Central Bank with effect from July 1, 2020 has launched Floating Rate Savings Bond, 2020 (Taxable).
                The biggest difference between earlier 7.75% savings bonds and the newly launched floating rate bond is
                that the interest rate on the newly launched savings bond is subject to reset every six months. In the
                7.75% bonds, the interest rate was fixed for the entire duration of the investment. Currently, the bonds
                are offering an interest rate of 7.15 per cent. The next reset on the interest rate is due on June 1,
                2021.</p>
