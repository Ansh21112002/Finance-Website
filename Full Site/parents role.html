                Role</h1><br>
            <h2>“Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime”</h2>
            <p>PARENTING is one of the most researched areas in the field of social science and we are still learning.
                Parenting is the most fulfilling job that we will ever have, but it’s not without its challenges.
                Research show that financial related education is the least discussed topic between parent-child. About
                81 per cent of parents don’t explain financial difficulties to their children, while 76 per cent do not
                discuss investment topics. Only 12 per cent of parents have family finance discussions with their
                children.
                Looking at the breakdown, I think we are still far behind in giving informal financial education to our
                children. I believe poor financial habits that adults have today are because of deep-rooted and mooted
                issues from their childhood.

                Since financial education is not taught in schools, it’s up to parents to make sure their children learn
                the basic personal finance at home. Let’s discuss how as a parent we can play our role in increasing the
                financial literacy of our children.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Be a role model</h2>
            <p>Financial education in child development is acquired through observation and imitation from parents.
                Therefore, positive role models for children are important in motivating their development.
                Before telling our children to have a budget with their money, we should develop our own budget and show
                them how we manage our money. The most important idea is setting a good example.
                Parents are the ideal figure in a child’s life. Parents play a major role in how our children turn out
                to be and children respect parents who walk their talk.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Learning through financial game</h2>
            <p>Gamification in learning involves using game-based approach such as point scoring, peer competition,
                teamwork and score tables to drive interest in any area. We can use gamification elements to motivate
                our children to learn about finance.
                The goal is to maximise enjoyment while capturing the interest in financial education and inspiring them
                to continue learning. Some gamification tools we can use are Monopoly, Payday, The Game of Life,
                Cashflow for kids (Richdad) and many other online games that teach children about money.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Let children be involved in household finances</h2>
            <p>When you are developing a financial plan, setting a family budget or facing a financial crisis, it’s
                important to involve your children. By involving them, we can build a tighter budget or ask children to
                assist in providing solutions in managing family expenses.
                This will improve their financial literacy. Brainstorming family finance ideas with children and saving
                on utilities by enjoying home cooked meals at home creates good family bonding too.
            </p><br>

            <h2>Family values</h2>
            <p>Family values define what is meaningful to the family as they are the beliefs and ideas that bind the
                family together for a common goal. Family values can develop positive financial behaviour.
                For example, creating a family motto such as ‘simplicity’ or ‘minimalist’. No matter what definition of
                family values, a set of family values provides a moral compass, clearly articulating the attitudes and
                meanings the family associates with financial beliefs.
                These family beliefs define what is important and what is good. They help teach children the difference
                between right and wrong when it comes to financial decisions.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Introduction to investment</h2>
            While saving is an easy way to begin a child’s financial journey, investment is the next necessary step in
            making money work. We should point out the differences between saving and investing and go over the risks
            and rewards of investment with our children. By investing, children are not only keeping their money, they
            are making it work for them.
            It’s been said that money is a bad master, but a good servant. Explain the term inflation, time value of
            money, compounding, risk and returns, to them. Once children have some experience, let them invest a small
            amount of money in robo advisors, unit trust, bonds or stocks. We can set a custodial account and contribute
            part of their savings for investment.
            There is much evidence on lack of financial literacy being a global problem. The real question is, how can
            we play our part as parents? Education starts at home. We can address financial education to children at a
            young age. Financial education allows children to be more financially independent and create a better life
            for themselves. There is no doubt about it, good financial literacy would be better for their future. It’s
            never too early to teach children about money.
            The earlier they learn, the better they will be at financial literacy once they become adults. We blame the
            economy for the present financial problems, that might be partially true but that is not the whole story.
            A lot of personal financial crises that we experience as adults are actually due to poor financial planning.
            By teaching our children about money early, we can save them a lot of financial despair, freeing them up to
            pursue what they truly want to do in life.<br>

            <h3>IT’S NEVER TOO EARLY TO START</h3>
            <p>Financial skills are complex, but having conversations with children early on can help them understand
                the value of money. One easy way to teach this is to encourage them to think about what they could buy
                if they were to save their money, instead of spending it on toys or a treat. Metaphors like, “Money does
                not grow on trees, but if you put it in a bank, it could grow like a tree” are good ways of
                communicating about money to young children.</p><br>
            <h3>RECOGNIZE THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL ARE CRUCIAL</h3>
            <p>Students will soon be making independent financial decisions. The last two years of high school are the
                right time to ramp up your efforts by getting specific about debit cards, bills, debt, budgeting, and
                savings. This is also the time to engage in deeper conversations about money and consider the social and
                cultural taboos (i.e. the belief that talking about money signals vulnerability or feelings of being
                judged) that prevent families from discussing money matters. Fostering openness will allow for better
                confidence in financial decision-making.</p><br>

            <h3>Parents would not dream of raising illiterate children - so why does it seem that to many parents,
                financial literacy is less of a priority?<br><br></h3>

            <p>Children learn more about finances from their parents than any other source, previous research has shown.
                The process through which parents impart this knowledge onto their children is known as "financial
                socialization."<br>
                It's important for parents to give kids age-appropriate financial experiences when they're monitoring
                them.
                Let children make mistakes so parents can help them learn from them, and help them develop habits before
                they're on their own, when the consequences are a lot bigger and they're dealing with larger amounts of
                money
                <br><br>

                With the goal of financial literacy in mind, consider these four strategies to help teach your children
                how to best manage their money. They are simple and effective, even for children still in elementary
                school.
                <br><br>
                1. Create a <b>financial mission statement </b>for your family. Solicit input from your family about
                what each member thinks is important. Is it eating out, taking vacations, saving for college, or all of
                these goals? Have an open conversation with your children to encourage them to think about the meaning
                of money, the challenge of earning it, and the importance of saving for what they truly value.
                <br><br>
                2. <b> Take opportunities </b>in your daily activities to model how you make spending decisions. By
                discussing money-making decisions as you shop, cook, and pay bills, you provide concrete examples that
                your children can model. Plus, taking the kids to the grocery store and cooking dinner afterwards
                teaches them to apply their math skills in the real world.
                <br><br>
                For example, having them bag groceries with you at the checkout shows them how much it really costs to
                fill up the fridge each week. You might encourage them to compare the costs of the meals they help
                prepare at home to what the meals might cost at a restaurant or fast-food establishment. <br><br>

                3. <b>Give your kids opportunities </b>to earn money. Consider the idea of paying an age-appropriate
                allowance to your kids. Whether you believe that it’s better to tie an allowance to doing chores, or to
                give a small stipend without conditions is a matter of constant debate. Either way, an allowance is a
                great way to teach kids how to handle their own money. <br><br>

                4. <b>Allow children firsthand experience</b> in saving and spending their own money. Open a savings
                account for your children early, and consider allowing them to manage the records. They can monitor
                their savings activity over the years. By the time they become teenagers, the benefit of saving
                regularly over time will be apparent, because they will have some money to spend on clothes, food, and
                friends – and still save for college. And by the time they head off to the university of their dreams,
                they will be more likely to have a savvy sensibility about managing their expenses.
                <br><br>
                One of the hard parts of giving children some control over their own money is that they are sure to make
                some mistakes. It is important not to rescue them from every mistake! Children need the benefit of
                making their own decisions. By learning from their mistakes, they become adults who can manage their
                money well.
                The best approach is a combination, where parents are setting a good example, they're having open,
                ongoing conversations about money, and kids have the opportunity to practice," <br>
            </p>
            <h3>How important is financial literacy?</h3>
            <p>Building up students’ financial literacy is critical not only to their understanding of personal
                finances, but also to their role in the local and global economy as consumers, employees, and employers.
                Teachers and parents have an important role in equipping students with the knowledge and skills to make
                healthy and informed financial decisions. Setting simple, age-appropriate goals that focus on the value
                of money, the importance of budgeting and saving, and evaluating the consequences of financial
                decisions, sets the foundation for students to become financially confident adults.</p>
