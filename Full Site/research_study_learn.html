            <h2>SOME STEPS TO STUDY AND LEARN FINANCE WITHOUT A FINANCE BACKGROUND:</h2><br><br>
            <h3>1. Read the Books</h3>
            <p>In order to get started, personal finance books will become key in your quest to be financially literate.
                It was crucial for my education, especially coming from no background in finance or investing.
                Dedicate a minimum of 1-2 hours each week to reading books about managing your money, investing, how to
                budget, etc.
            <h4>Best Personal Finance Books for Beginners</h4>

            starting with if you have very little knowledge about money, budgeting, debt, or investing. Let’s dive in
            below.

            <h3>2. Read a Magazine</h3>
            <p>I find books to be the most important, but financial magazines and online publications can be equally
                important to your financial education.
                Think publications like Kiplinger, Financial Times, Fortune, and there are tons of personal finance
                bloggers (like me).
                Also, websites like Bankrate, Student Loan Hero, BiggerPockets, GoBankingRates, and Investopedia have
                tons of useful information, online calculators, and more.
            </p><br>

            <h3>3. Online tools for budget framing</h3>
            <p>Managing your finances and money doesn’t have to be hard or boring. Thanks to the tech and the internet,
                there is an abundance of money tools to help you be more proficient.</p><br>

            <h3>4. Listen to Financial literacy Podcasts</h3>
            <p>Being able to dedicate time to reading can be challenging. You may have a busy work and family life,
                which is exactly why podcasts are perfect.
                Podcasting is huge!
                And there are many great ones you can listen to on your way to or from work, doing chores, or even at
                work (if it doesn’t disrupt your productivity).
                There are too many awesome podcasts to list and all vary in length from 10 minutes to almost an hour of
                strong info. This is free financial advice you can listen to! H

            <h3>5. Takeup any Financial Literacy Course</h3>
            <p>So besides books and online publications, you can totally get involved in a financial literacy class or
                course. Whether that is at an online school, college course, adult education center, etc.
                This is if you feel you want to go a step further or need the structure to learn. Many are paid, but
                there are some free courses online that can be a great educator too.
                Various courses are available on udemy and coursera
            </p><br>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>6. Establish your "why"</h3>
            <p>Consider the tangible ways financial literacy can help you. Ask yourself, “What will learning about
                finance help me gain in my personal life and career?”
                Perhaps it can enable you to be a stronger job candidate, get promoted at work, or contribute to
                financial discussions that impact your team. It can also equip you to understand the relationship
                between current events and your personal finances.
                Whatever your reason for building your financial literacy, write it down and reference it throughout
                your learning process. Use it as a motivator when you need encouragement.</p><br>

            <h3>7. Determine Which Learning Method Is Best for You</h3>
            <p>There are multiple ways you can learn about finance, including in-person classes, reading financial
                publications, self-teaching from finance books, and joining a network of financial professionals.
                Choosing the method that’s right for you involves weighing multiple factors, such as your:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> style: Everyone learns differently. You may be a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner. Finding
                    a course that allows you to hear the information, see it presented visually, and engage in
                    interactive exercises can allow you to incorporate all three learning styles.</li>
                <li>Budget: Everyone’s budgets for personal and professional growth look different. Your budget might
                    restrict you to free resources, or maybe it allows for a paid course. Remember that learning about
                    finance is an investment in yourself and your career.</li>
                <li>Schedule: Whether you have a nine to five job, work overnight shifts, have children in school or
                    childcare, or other obligations, the key is to choose a learning method that fits your schedule. If
                    your learning interferes with other aspects of life, you may be less likely to see it through and
                    reach your goals.</li>
                <li>Transportation options: Transportation options should be taken into account, as well, especially if
                    you’re considering an in-person finance class. Whatever learning method you choose, make sure it’s
                    the right fit for you. </li>
            </ul><br>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>8. Dedicate Time to Your Learning:</h3>
            <p>Once you’ve chosen a method that works for you, set aside a specific time each day or week to learn about
                finance. Scheduling this time can help make learning new skills part of your routine. Every time you sit
                down to complete your coursework, finish your reading, or engage in financial conversations, you can
                feel proud knowing that you’re consciously dedicating time to your growth.</p><br>
            <h3>9. Make Connections to Real-World Situations</h3>
            <p>To root your understanding of financial principles in reality, strive to connect the material back to
                real-world examples whenever possible</p><br>
            <h3>10. Interact With Other Financial Professionals</h3>
            <p>As you set out to learn finance, you may feel alone in your endeavor, but that couldn’t be further from
                the truth. Interacting with people who have similar goals and backgrounds can stimulate interesting
                conversations, open your eyes to new perspectives.</p><br>
            <h3>11. Keep Asking Questions</h3>
            <p>After you’ve completed your studies, the key is to never stop learning. Use your newfound knowledge as a
                springboard to pose questions you wouldn’t have previously been able to ask. Finance is a
                deep,far-reaching subject, and there will always be more and more to learn.</p><br>
        </div>


        <div class="card">

            <h2>INVEST IN YOUR GROWTH</h2><br>
            <p>With these steps in mind, all that’s left to do is take the leap. Putting time into your personal and
                professional growth is truly a worthwhile investment. Financial literacy can allow you to land a new
                job, lead your team, and position yourself to feel well-informed and empowered, regardless of your
                background.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>The Benefits of Financial Literacy</h2><br>
            <p>By now, you probably are starting to understand the power of financial literacy. You probably are also
                piecing together the benefits this will have on your present and future finances.
                And you have the tips to get you on the right path.
                But if you need some further convincing, here are some of the benefits of becoming financially literate.
            </p><br>
            <h3>You gain control</h3>
            <p>Instead of letting money control you, now you hold the reins to your personal finances. This empowers you
                and makes you feel more confident and decisive with your money.
                Additionally, your attitude towards finances changes. The way you look and think about money alters for
                the better.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Value financial goals</h3>
            <p>As you gain financial knowledge, you’ll be more inclined to set goals for yourself. And besides that, you
                may find yourself excited and more determined to work towards achieving those goals.</p>
