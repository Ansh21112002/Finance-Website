                AND BUDGET FRAMING :</h1><br><br>
            <h2>1. Learn Self-Control</h2><br>
            <p>If you’re lucky, your parents taught you this skill when you were a kid. If not, keep in mind that the
                sooner you learn the fine art of delaying gratification, the sooner you’ll find it easy to keep your
                personal finances in order. Although you can effortlessly buy an item on credit the minute you want it,
                it’s better to wait until you’ve actually saved up the money for the purchase. Do you really want to pay
                interest on a pair of jeans or a box of cereal? A debit card is as handy and takes the money from your
                checking account, rather than racking up interest charges.

                If you make a habit of putting all your purchases on credit cards despite not being able to pay your
                bill in full at the end of the month, then you might still be paying for those items in 10 years. Credit
                cards are convenient, and paying them off on time helps you build a good credit rating. And some offer
                appealing rewards. Except in rare emergencies, though, make sure to always pay your balance in full when
                the bill arrives. Also, don’t carry more cards than you can keep track of. This financial tip is crucial
                for creating a healthy credit history.
            </p><br>
            <h2>2. Control Your Financial Future:</h2><br>
            <p>If you don’t learn to manage your money, then other people will find ways to mismanage it for you. Some
                of these people may be ill-intentioned, like unscrupulous, commission-based financial planners. Others
                may be well-meaning but may not know what they’re doing, like Grandma Betty, who really wants you to own
                your own house even though you can only afford one by taking on a risky adjustable-rate mortgage.


                Instead of relying on others for advice, take charge and read a few basic books on personal finance.
                Once you’re armed with knowledge, don’t let anyone catch you off guard—whether it’s a significant other
                who slowly siphons off your bank account or friends who want you to go out and blow tons of money with
                them every weekend.
            </p><br>
            <h2>3. Know Where Your Money Goes:</h2><br>
            <p>Once you’ve gone through a few personal finance books, you’ll realize how important it is to make sure
                that your expenses aren’t exceeding your income. The best way to do this is by budgeting. Once you see
                how the cost of your morning coffee adds up over the course of a month, you’ll realize that making
                small, manageable changes in your everyday expenses can have as big an impact on your financial
                situation as getting a raise.

                In addition, keeping your recurring monthly expenses as low as possible can save you significant money
                over time. Even if you can swing an amenity-packed apartment now, picking something planner could let
                you afford to own a condominium or house sooner than you otherwise would.

                Understanding how money works is the first step toward making your money work for you.

            <h2>4. Start an Emergency Fund:</h2><br>
            <p>One of personal finance’s most-repeated mantras is “pay yourself first.” No matter how much you owe in
                student loans or credit card debt, and no matter how low your salary may seem, it’s wise to find some
                amount—any amount—of money in your budget to sock away in an emergency fund every month.

                Having money in savings to use for emergencies can keep you out of trouble financially and help you
                sleep better at night. Also, if you get into the habit of saving money and treating it as a
                nonnegotiable monthly expense, then pretty soon, you’ll have more than just emergency money saved
                up—you’ll have retirement money, vacation money, or even money for a down payment on a home.

                It’s easy to put your fund into a standard savings account, but this earns almost no interest. Put your
                fund in a high-interest online savings account, short-term certificate of deposit (CD), or money market
                account. Otherwise, inflation will erode the value of your savings. Just make sure the rules of your
                savings vehicle permit you to get to your money quickly in an emergency.
            </p><br>
            <h2>5. Start Saving for Retirement:</h2><br>
            <p>Just as your parents probably sent you off to kindergarten with high hopes of preparing you for success
                in a world that seemed eons away, you need to plan for your retirement well in advance. Because of the
                way compound interest works, the sooner you start saving, the less principal you’ll have to invest to
                end up with the amount that you need to retire.

                Why start saving for your retirement in your 20s? Here’s an Investopedia example: You start investing in
                the market at $100 a month, averaging a positive return of 1% a month or 12% a year, compounded monthly
                over 40 years. Your friend, who is the same age, doesn’t begin investing until 30 years later and
                invests $1,000 a month for 10 years, also averaging 1% a month or 12% a year, compounded monthly. After
                10 years, your friend will have saved up around $230,000. Your retirement account will be a bit over
                $1.17 million.

                Company-sponsored retirement plans are a particularly great choice, because you get to put in pretax
                dollars and companies will often match part of your contribution, which is like getting free money.
                Contribution limits tend to be higher for 401(k)s than for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), but
                any employer-sponsored plan that you’re fortunate enough to be offered is a step closer to financial
                health.2

                If you don’t have access to a company plan, don’t despair. Those who are self-employed have a range of
                options for setting up retirement plans. Others can open their own IRAs, allowing for a set amount of
                money each month to be withdrawn from your savings account and contributed directly into your IRA. Even
                if it’s only a small sum, it will eventually add up to something helpful.
            </p><br>
            <h2>6. Get a Grip on Taxes:</h2><br>
            <p>It’s important to understand how income taxes work even before you get your first paycheck. When a
                company offers you a starting salary, you need to know how to calculate whether that salary will give
                you enough money after taxes to meet your financial obligations—and, you hope, meet your goals.

                Fortunately, there are plenty of online calculators that take the dirty work out of determining your
                payroll taxes, such as PaycheckCity.com.3 These calculators will show you your gross pay, how much goes
                to taxes, and how much you’ll be left with—which is also known as net pay or take-home pay. For example,
                an annual salary of $35,000 in New York City would leave you with around $27,490 after federal taxes
                without exemptions for the 2020–2021 filing season—about $2,291 a month.4 Then you need to consider
                state and (for New York City) city taxes in addition.

                By the same token, if you’re considering leaving one job for another in search of a salary increase,
                then you’ll need to understand how your marginal tax rate will affect your raise. For example, a salary
                increase from $35,000 a year to $41,000 a year won’t give you an extra $6,000 per year ($500 per
                month)—it will only give you an extra $4,227 (around $352 per month).4 The amount will vary depending on
                your state of residence and its potential tax bite, so take that into consideration if you’re pondering
                a move.

                Finally, take the time to learn to do your own taxes. Unless you have a complicated financial situation,
                it’s not that hard to do, and you won’t have the expense of paying a tax professional for the work. Tax
                software makes the job much easier than it was when your parents were starting out and ensures that you
                can file online.

            <h2>7. Guard Your Health</h2><br>
            <p>If meeting monthly health insurance premiums seems impossible, what will you do if you have to go to the
                emergency room—where a single visit for a minor injury like a broken bone can cost thousands of dollars?
                If you’re uninsured, don’t wait another day to apply for health insurance. It’s easier than you think to
                wind up in a car accident or trip and fall down a flight of stairs.

                If you’re employed, then your employer may offer health insurance, including high-deductible health
                plans that save on premiums and qualify you for a Health Savings Account (HSA). If you need to buy
                insurance on your own, investigate the plans offered by the Health Insurance Marketplace of the
                Affordable Care Act (ACA). There are federal plans, or your state may have its own plan. Look at quotes
                from different insurance providers to find the lowest rates and see if you qualify for a subsidy based
                on your income. If you have health issues, know that a more expensive plan could be cost-effective for
                you. Research all your options.

                If you’re under age 26, then your best choice may be to stay on your parents’ health insurance if they
                have it—an option allowed since the 2010 passage of the ACA. If you can manage it, offer to reimburse
                them for the additional cost of keeping you on their plan.

                It also pays to take daily steps now to keep yourself healthy—such as eating fruits and vegetables,
                maintaining a healthy weight, exercising, not smoking, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, and
                driving defensively. All these behaviors can save you on medical bills down the road.

            <h2>8. Protect Your Wealth</h2><br>
            <p>To make sure that all of your hard-earned money doesn’t vanish, you’ll need to take steps to protect it.
                Here are some steps to think about, even if you can’t afford them all right now:

                If you rent, get renters insurance to protect the contents of your place from events such as burglary or
                fire. Read the policy carefully to see what’s covered and what isn’t.

                Disability insurance protects your greatest asset—the ability to earn an income—by providing you with a
                steady income if you ever become unable to work for an extended period of time due to illness or injury.

                If you want help managing your money, find a fee-only financial planner to provide unbiased advice
                that’s in your best interest, rather than a commission-based financial advisor, who earns money when you
                sign up with the investments that their company backs. The latter has a potentially divided loyalty (to
                their company’s bottom line, and to you), while the former has no incentive to guide you down a wrong
                path.

                You’ll also want to protect your money from taxes—which is easy to do with a retirement account—and from
                inflation, which you can do by making sure that all of your money is earning interest. There are a
                variety of vehicles in which you can invest your savings, such as high-interest savings accounts, money
                market funds, CDs, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The first three are relatively free of risk, while
                the remaining three carry greater possibilities for financial setbacks but also greater possibilities
                for monetary rewards. Learning about investing is an important skill for building up your savings—and,
                eventually, building wealth.

                The Bottom Line
                Remember, you don’t need any fancy degrees or special background to become an expert at managing your
                finances. If you use these eight financial rules and financial tips for your life, then you can be as
                personally prosperous as someone with a hard-earned MBA in finance.

            </h1><br><br>
            <h2>1.Save money on your big expenses like housing and transportation – </h2><br>
            <p>Don’t worry too much about saving money on the small stuff, like coffee, wine, or anything that brings
                you joy. You are always going to be able to save the most money where you spend the most money.


                Focus on saving on your two biggest expenses: housing and transportation. The average American spends
                over 60% of their income on housing and transportation.

                Try to reduce, or eliminate your housing expenses as soon as you can. The easiest way is to start house
                hacking, which is the simple idea of renting or buying a large apartment or house and renting out the
                other rooms or units. Not only can you live rent or mortgage-free, but you can also actually make money
                on your living situation. Real estate is also the fastest path to retire early.

                You can easily reduce your transportation expenses by always buying used cars instead of new ones. You
                can buy a great car that will last you years for under $5,000. The average new car price in the United
                States is now almost $40,000. It’s just not worth it – especially when you’re young to sink that much
                money into a car. Start investing instead. Also, if you plan to use a credit card, use one of the best
                airline credit cards, to make sure you’re getting the most miles and start travel hacking!

                Minimizing your housing and transportation expenses is especially important when you’re young and just
                starting on your financial journey. The next 3-5 years are the most important in your financial life
                because they build the foundation of your compounding engine – where your money starts working for you.
                Then you can move to a bigger apartment or even buy a new car if you want. But make sure you have at
                least $100k invested before you do.
            </p><br>
            <h2>2. Think through your purchases before you make them –</h2><br>
            <p>The best money-saving tip is to think through your purchases before you buy it. Advertisers can sell to
                your emotions, which leads you to buy a lot of things you don’t need. Other times, they sell you on one
                aspect of the item which sounds good, but when you step back and look at the whole picture, you realize
                that the item doesn’t make sense for you.

                For example, they use tricks like one-day sales even though the item will be on sale again in a few
                months. Or if you are buying something online, you will see a countdown timer. This makes you think you
                need to buy before the timer runs out or the item is gone forever. But if you come back to the site
                later, you will see the timer has started all over again.

                Another example is hybrid cars. Sure they save you money on gas, but most people end up spending more
                money in total on a hybrid than if they just purchased a non-hybrid car.

                At the end of the day, always take the time to think about a purchase before you buy it. Think about how
                you will use it and how it will benefit you and your life. Then consider not buying it and what your
                life would look like. Chances are you would be fine without many of the things you are considering
                buying.


                By taking the time to weigh the pros and cons, you will save yourself a lot of regrets and a lot of
                wasted money.
            </p><br>
            <h2>3. Figure out what you value most in life and why you want to save money –</h2><br>
            <p>Many experts will argue for the traditional tips and methods for saving money after college: start a
                budget, get a roommate, drive a used car, and pay yourself first through a 401k and/or IRA. And they’re
                right! This is fantastic advice.

                However, after talking with hundreds of young people about saving money, I’ve learned all of these
                strategies can be a bit premature if you haven’t figured out two things: what you value most in life and
                why you want to save money.

                For example, I created a budget after graduating from college, but it led me to spend over $200 on
                coffee during my first month at my new job. I thought, “I can afford it on paper, so it must be OK.” It
                took some time to realize it, but today I would much rather redirect that $200 per month toward
                something that adds more value to my life and while drinking a combination of home-brewed coffee and
                free Starbucks instead.

                Once you begin to form your own beliefs about what matters most to you, saving money becomes much
                easier. You’ll establish meaningful and tangible savings goals, like building an emergency fund or
                saving money for a house down payment.


                And as you make strides toward achieving your savings goals, you’ll become more and more motivated to
                gain any edge you can to speed up the process. For example, my wife and I have expanded our use of
                cashback apps to put more money back into our already disciplined budget so we can spend more on things
                that matter to us, like regular date nights and an annual family vacation.
            </p><br>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>4. Set a personal budget and spend within your means –</h2><br>
            <p>The best financial advice to give to young adults graduating from college is twofold.

                First, don’t waste your life trying to impress others. Falling into the trap of “keeping up with the
                Jones” is a surefire way to overextend yourself with your money and live a life of unhappiness. The
                sooner you realize that other people’s opinions of yourself don’t matter, the better.

                You don’t need the brand new car after you land your first real job just because everyone else is. You
                don’t need the brand new phone, Apple Watch, or to go out to lunch every day to fit in. Your younger
                years are the absolute most important years to set yourself up for financial freedom.

                Second, you must have a budget. Without tracking your spending it’s impossible to hit your savings and
                investing goals. Create a simple budget that works for you and stick to it. A budget will allow you to
                spend like crazy on the things that bring you the most joy/happiness in life and cut costs significantly
                on the things that don’t. Not having a budget at all is not an option. Sticking to a budget is the
                secret sauce for crushing your financial goals.

            <h2>5. Always shop with a calculator –</h2><br>
            <p>The best money-saving tip for young adults is to shop with a calculator. Using a calculator while
                shopping will help you stay on top of your spending and you will spend less money.


                This is especially useful when grocery shopping. The largest category we tend to overspend on is food
                and this will help you save a ton of money at the grocery store.

                In addition to using a calculator while shopping, you can save even more money by meal planning with a
                shopping list and take only cash for groceries. That means, leave your cards at home. Don’t give
                yourself a backup plan to overspend.

                If you know you only have $200 to spend, then you will only spend $200. If you use a calculator while
                you are shopping, you will know when you are getting close to your limit and can remove items from your
                cart before you checkout.

                The great thing is that you have a calculator built right into your phone! You can use your phone while
                shopping, which let’s be honest, you are all ready. So, use your phone to save you money while you are
                shopping.

                Be sure to round up to account for tax and give yourself a little cushion.

            <h2>6. Protect your money by buying insurance early</h2><br>
            <p>Simply Insurance
                The key to being responsible with your money is to first protect it. You should purchase a long-term
                disability insurance product. I like to call it paycheck insurance because that’s what it does; it
                insures your paycheck.

                Once you have paycheck insurance you need to get a term life insurance policy because it will be the
                cheapest it will ever be for you as a young adult.


                If you get a term life insurance policy today, when you decide to have a family it’s just as simple as
                adding them as beneficiaries to the policy but you get to have much lower rates locked in.

                Being responsible with money also means making sure you don’t spend it aimlessly, that is why you must
                have some type of dental coverage. If you take preventative steps with your dental health now, it will
                save you tens of thousands of dollars in the future.

                While it might not seem like it at first, buying your insurance products earlier in life is going to
                save you so much money in the long run, it is the best way to start being a responsible saver

            <h2>7. Have a financial plan in place before you become fully independent –</h2><br>
            <p>Invested Wallet
                Getting your first job after graduating from college is exciting, even a bit scary. But you feel more
                independent and self-reliant than ever before. It may entice you further to be independent of your
                parents. You may want to move into your own place, get a new car, etc. It can all sound like the right
                steps. And they are, but in due time.

                A mistake a lot of recent grads starting jobs make is immediately wanting to live on their own with no
                financial plan. You could be letting the excitement and job do the decision making for you, which can
                impact your finances big time. Again, you should not be relying on the bank and house of mom and dad,
                but if you can, don’t move out on your own immediately.

                Make sure you have a few month’s expenses saved, are prepared to pay utility bills, can cover unexpected
                emergencies, and are also able to pay your student loans back on time (if you have any). Create a
                financial plan for yourself, figure out what your goals are, and how you can afford to be on your own
                right away. If the math doesn’t work, take the time to work on your finances and make adult moves when
                the math is making sense.

                I made this exact mistake when I was 22. I had a salaried job with benefits (not that I was making much,
                but most I ever made) and was eager to move out on my own. But, I had very little in savings and the
                cost of rent, utilities, student loan payments, and credit card payments did not put me in a good
                financial situation. I could pay for everything but had very little leftover to save. For the next few
                years, I had very little money saved or invested for my future and was constantly stressed about money.

            <h2>8. Invest in yourself and have a long-term mindset – </h2><br>
            <p>Jordan @ Yore Oyster / How I Travel
                Building wealth is a science, not an art, which means that it comes down to definable, replicable
                building blocks. Here are the two biggest:


                Invest in Yourself – If you think college was the last time you’ll need to learn something new, think
                again. In today’s competitive workforce, anyone who isn’t constantly learning and changing to meet
                market demands is going to quickly get left behind. Interested in graphic design or building your own
                website? There are thousands of online resources (think YouTube, Coursera, etc.) to help you get started
                in these areas, plus countless more. Now that the education barrier has been broken down, and you can
                learn just about anything online for free (or next to free), you can create huge returns for yourself
                just by investing in your own set of marketable skills.

                Think Long-Term – Don’t get caught up in the hype of short-term, get-rich-quick investments. This
                doesn’t only apply to things you see on late-night TV—it can also apply to today’s hot stocks,
                time-sensitive business models, or anything else. As you get older, you come to realize the value of the
                time-tested and proven: if something has been working for the past thousand years, it will probably
                continue to work for a while longer, too. Wealth accumulation is a marathon, not a sprint, so respect
                that and have some patience.

                If you do both of these things, you’ll be well on your way to building serious wealth. Of course, it
                won’t happen overnight, but compound interest is a magical thing, and before you know it, you’ll be in
                the seven figures and beyond.

            <h2>9. Lower your big three expenses: housing, transportation, and food –</h2><br>
            <p>Richmond @ PF Geeks
                My best money-saving tip for young adults is to focus on lowering their big 3 expenses: housing,
                transportation, and food.

                When it comes to food, people tend to waste money either by eating out or buying food that ends up going
                to waste. Food spending is one of the budget categories that people have the most control over in their
                day to day spending. You can choose to eat out or bring lunch.

                My favorite way to save money on food is by meal prepping: cooking in bulk and eating throughout the
                week. I try to focus on eating cheap meals for less than $2 each so that I can enjoy life a little more
                on the weekends. This has allowed me to lower my food spending by over half while still getting to eat
                and enjoy good food all the time.

            <h2>10. Find cheap ways to entertain yourself – </h2><br>
            <p>Aaron @ Personal Finance for Beginners
                It’s Friday night. You’ve just finished a long week of work, and you’re finally free to relax and enjoy
                your weekend.

                You feel like you owe it to yourself to have a good time, so you decide to drop a hundred dollars on
                dinner, drinks, and a ticket to see your favorite band. Your 20s are all about making memories, right?


                Unfortunately, this type of behavior often leads young adults into living paycheck-to-paycheck, or even
                worse, piled under credit card debt.

                If you’re ready to get your finances in order, one of the best things you can do is find cheap ways to
                have fun when you’re bored. You can still enjoy the hobbies and activities you love, but also find cheap
                or free things you can do that won’t require breaking the bank or sabotaging your goals.

                Some of my favorite ways to have fun while saving money include cooking meals at home, attending free
                classes at the local library, and spending time outside.

                Here’s a simple hack that can help: try a “cash-only diet” for your entertainment. Each paycheck,
                withdraw $100 (or whatever you have budgeted) and commit to only spending that money on your fun
                expenses. Spend it guilt-free, but once it’s gone, you must stick to only free sources of entertainment
                until your next paycheck!

            <h2>11. Always collect your receipts when shopping – </h2><br>
            <p>Tom @ This Online World
                When it comes to saving money as a young adult, one of the most impactful changes I made was to start
                collecting my receipts every time I shopped. During my college years, I had absolutely no idea about how
                much money I spent every month on groceries, alcohol, or entertainment, and money generally felt pretty
                tight.

                However, shortly after getting my first full-time job out of college, I started to keep every receipt
                after I shopped. Once a week, I’d sit down and log all of my purchases in an Excel budget tracker, which
                broke down my main categories of spending. I also started logging online purchases as well, and within a
                few weeks, I was in the habit of adding all of my expenses to my budgeting sheet.

                You will never have control of your finances unless you budget and track your spending. A budget allows
                you to spot spending trends before they get out of control, to monitor weak points, and to have a
                macro-level understanding of your finances. I know there’s a plethora of budgeting apps and websites out
                there, but I recommend using receipts. There’s just something immensely satisfying about crossing out a
                receipt and chucking it in the garbage once you’ve added it to your sheet, and having to deal with a
                physical representation of your spending might make you think twice before you splurge on something
                unnecessary!

            <h2>12. Save up to 63% on life insurance – </h2><br>
            <p>Michael @ Life Insurance Blog
                Life insurance is one of the most important purchases of a new professional. Many things start to happen
                once you begin your career. Maybe you’ve recently gotten married or started to have children. Perhaps
                you purchased a new home. Life insurance will help protect your young family now and in the future if
                you were to die unexpectedly. The good news is that life insurance should be very inexpensive when
                you’re in your 20s or 30s. Buying a 30-year term life policy will be affordable for most. However, the
                buying process is very confusing for most shoppers and they may end up paying much more than they
                should.


                The number one tip to save money on your life insurance policy is to use an independent agent.

                An independent life insurance agent can shop your policy from multiple companies and find the one that
                will offer you the best deal based on your specific health and lifestyle. The cost of life insurance can
                range significantly from company to company even if you’re buying the same 30-year term policy.

                Here’s an example: A 30-year old man is shopping for a $500,000 30-year term life policy. He was
                diagnosed with ADHD several years ago. This health condition isn’t an issue with some companies, but
                other companies will rate him up. Depending on the company he buys from, he can spend anywhere from $31
                to $83 per month — that’s a potential savings of up to 63% if the right company is chosen!

                Make sure to use an agent that has access to dozens of companies. The more the better. This gives them
                the best chance to find the carrier that will offer you the best policy at the lowest price.

            <h2>13. Save for emergencies and learn to control your spending habits – </h2><br>
            <p>Chhavi & Amit @ Mrs. Daak Studio
                Save for emergencies – It is difficult for recent college students to understand the need for an
                emergency fund. After all, the thought is, what emergency can I have? The thing is – whether or not you
                can foresee an emergency, it is always a good idea to save a part of your income into an emergency fund.
                It may not be useful to you right away but in the future, you will be happy with the decision that you
                made.

                Learn to control your spending habits – I am guilty of this. I spent my first salary buying presents,
                new clothes and partying with friends. If I were to be 100% truthful, I was an impulse buyer. I was
                easily sucked into sales, limited edition, limited offers, etc. This is very common amongst new grads.
                What I want to tell you is simple – control your spending habits and learn to say no to things that you
                do not need. Always ask yourself – do you really need that thing? Can you live without it?

            <h2>14. Build wealth by paying yourself first – </h2><br>
            <p>Cara @ Smart Money Tips
                One way to build wealth is to pay yourself first. All the personal finance books advise you to do it.
                All the wealthy gurus advise it, too. Maybe your parents told you the same thing.

                But it’s not that easy. That money can be spent on something fun that you want to do or something that
                you want to buy. Maybe you’ve tried before, but you just couldn’t stick with it. You haven’t created a
                budget, so when you get paid, you end up spending the money on something else.

                “What’s the big deal about paying yourself first,” you ask.

                Well, paying yourself first allows you to save a part of your income before you spend any money on bills
                or groceries. You put the money into an investment such as a 401(k), or a savings account. As soon as
                you get paid, you should pay yourself. The sooner you incorporate this practice, the higher the chance
                you have to become wealthy.

                I know that when you’re starting in life, saving is tough to do. You have so many bills that it seems
                overwhelming. Yes, you want to save, but there’s not enough money to go around. And that’s why most
                people struggle their whole lives with money: They keep what’s leftover instead of paying themselves
                first. You’ll never regret paying yourself first.
            </p><br>
            <h2>15. Learn to build frugal habits into your lifestyle – </h2><br>
            <p>Joyce @ Financial Impulse
                Build frugality into your lifestyle. For some people, making an extra effort to save money is difficult
                because it feels like forced deprivation. However, you can avoid this struggle by changing your mindset
                when it comes to saving. How? Rather than feeling deprived of making “active” saving decisions, you can
                cultivate frugal habits.


                For example, a transition to drinking mostly water, learning to cook, and buy in bulk. Over time, once
                these cost-friendly behaviors become normal parts of your routine, saving won’t feel like you’re losing
                out on something or going out of your way. Instead, saving money will become second-nature.

                Additionally, consider living at home. If your circumstances allow (e.g., your workplace is not far from
                your parents’ home), you can reduce your expenses significantly by living at home. Rent and utilities
                don’t come cheap, after all, especially if you live in a high cost-of-living area.

                Of course, the ability to live at home depends in large part on your relationship with your parents, as
                some parents may still charge rent or ask that you help pay the bills. If your parents are open to the
                idea, however, you can save significantly more living at home than if you were renting an apartment.
                This can help accelerate paying off any debt you may have, like a student loan or car payment.

                Alternatively, if you don’t have debt, living at home can boost your savings and make it easier to reach
                your larger financial goals (like buying your own home) even faster. Living at home generally comes with
                some more flexibility. You can stay with your parents for as short or as long as you all agree on,
                whether that’s only a few months or a full year.

            <h2>16. Learn to pay yourself first –</h2><br>
            <p>Amy @ Early Morning Money
                After college is over, the thrill of earning a living can lead to overspending. This might be the first
                time you’ve had that much money hit your bank account each month. But don’t get into the habit of
                spending just because you have the cash. Instead, think about how to create good financial habits that
                can sustain you when life throws a curveball.

                Since buying a new car or the newest tech gadget tends to be more fun than saving money, the first habit
                to put in place is paying yourself first. If you don’t prioritize saving money, you’re unlikely to have
                money left after paying bills and buying groceries.

                Your best bet is to set up a recurring transfer to put saving on autopilot. Ask your employer to
                separate your direct deposit into two different accounts. Put at least 10% to a savings account and the
                rest into your checking for daily living expenses. If direct deposit isn’t available, talk to your bank
                about creating an automatic transfer at regular intervals.

                This creates a “set it and forget it” way to build your cash reserves. You’ll want to continue saving
                money even after you have three to six months of living expenses in an emergency fund. At this point,
                consider investing rather than leaving the cash to sit in a savings account. Investing can get you a
                better return on your money and set you on the path to financial independence.

                You are probably just coming out of college where you have feasted and dined on the finest sodium-based
                Ramen noodles and practiced every frugal living tip known to man.

                So, naturally, you may want to splurge a little bit on your lifestyle now. You will be very tempted to
                live that “keeping up with the Joneses” lifestyle once you start witnessing your friends enter into that
                stage.

                They’re going to be buying mansions and sports cars because interest rates are low and the economy is
                chugging along. However, recessions happen. They are real. Housing prices can fall and you will be left
                up to your eyeballs in debt.

                You can avoid this plague by creating a personal budget as soon as possible. Having a budget will help
                you keep track of your living expenses. This is good for several reasons because it helps you identify
                your short-term and long-term goals. Without a personal budget or direction, it’s very easy to spend
                wildly on all kinds of things.

            <h2>18. Live like a college student to avoid lifestyle inflation –</h2><br>
            <p>Robbie @ EAT Money
                Life as a new college graduate is such an exciting time of your life. Your time is your own and so is
                your money. Of course, you could have said the same thing in college but the money was nowhere what it
                is now that you graduated and got a job. You probably already have been eyeing that new car or that new
                iPhone and, to be frank, I don’t blame you.

                The best piece of advice I could offer a new college graduate is to live like a college student as long
                as you can. Don’t go out and buy that new car or upgrade your iPhone every year.

                It won’t be easy but this single decision may change your life. No, it’s not going to change it right
                now (at least for the better) and it won’t have too much of an impact a few years down the road.
                However, keep this same mindset for 10 years and you will be lightyears ahead of your peers.

                What most of your friends (and mine as well) probably did when they graduated was to start upgrading
                their car, their wardrobe, their nightlife and their life in general. If they are smart (which they
                probably are) they match their spending to their income. They probably think if I have money to pay the
                bills and there is money left in my account so I’m good to go.


                I hate to say it but they are wrong.

                Imagine if every time you get a raise you increase your level of spending to match. Do that for the next
                10 years and you won’t have a whole lot in savings. This phenomenon is called lifestyle inflation and it
                may be the single greatest wealth killer out there.

                I can’t stress it enough. Live like a college student. Make sure there is always a sizable and growing
                gap between what you earn and what you spend.

            <h2>19. Set aside some money in a high yield savings account –</h2><br>
            <p>Fo @ Girl Talk with Fo
                Saving money doesn’t have to be complicated or cumbersome. To ensure that this is the case, automate
                your savings to a high yield savings account.

                By automating a portion of your income to go to a savings account every time you get paid, you do the
                following:

                Save money without having to think about it
                Build of a nest egg for emergencies or other large purchases
                Lay the foundation for a strong financial future
                There are two ways that you can automate your savings.

                First, you can have your employer directly deposit a specific amount or percentage of your paycheck to a
                savings account. This is the best way, as you won’t even see your money to miss it.

                Secondly, you can automate a transfer to another savings account through your current bank. You simply
                set this up through the online portal of your bank. The downside is that you’ll see the money and may be
                tempted to spend it instead.


                Make saving money a priority in your finances. Set a realistic savings goal for each month, automate it,
                and track your progress.

                While you’re saving, you want your money to work for you. That means you want it to build interest and
                earn money for you.

                High yield savings accounts are the best way to do this. Leverage an online-only bank that offers a high
                annual percentage yield to make the most of your savings efforts.

            <h2>20. Take advantage of financial windfalls to save more money –</h2><br>
            <p>Stephanie @ Financial Freedom Crew
                I’ve found that the least painful way to save money is by taking advantage of windfalls. A windfall is
                “found” money or any cash that you receive outside of your usual pay.

                Money received as a gift for birthdays or holidays, bonuses, inheritances, and even cash back rewards
                are windfalls. Since the money is unexpected and you don’t routinely count on it to fund your lifestyle,
                you won’t miss it. No sacrifice is needed to save most, if not all, of it.

                Have a goal in mind so that, when you get unexpected money, you’re motivated to save it, not tempted to
                spend it.

                Paying down debt, building an emergency fund, or making large deposits to a retirement account can
                drastically reduce current and future money worries and stress.

                Perhaps you want to own a home or buy your first rental property to create a passive income, either of
                which can elevate your happiness long-term.

                Or maybe travel is your thing. Experiences are fun to save for because you get pleasure from not only
                taking the trip but also planning and remembering it.

                Think about what you could use the money for that would permanently increase your life satisfaction.
                Then, when you receive a windfall, you’re ready to maximize its impact.

                One final thing: you can also consider an increase in your hourly pay or salary a windfall. Many people
                increase their lifestyle (spending) to match an income increase. When they get a raise, they increase
                their expenses to match. Rather than moving to a more expensive home, buying a new car, or indulging in
                other “lifestyle inflation” when your pay rises, keep your expenses the same. Then funnel the extra
                money towards your goals.

            </p><br>
            <h2>21. Calculate your real hourly wage –</h2><br>
            <p>Kim @ The Frugal Engineers
                When comparing job offers, we typically look at the starting salary. How much are you earning after the
                expenses of working the job? If you feel like you’re earning a good salary but wondering where the
                money’s gone, this is for you. Knowing your real hourly wage helps you make informed decisions about the
                type of work you do and spending habits. You can calculate your real hourly wage here.


                Begin with dividing your salary by 2,000 work hours in a year (40 hours/week * 50 weeks, assuming two
                weeks of vacation). A $65,000 salary equals $32.50/hour.

                First, we’ll subtract out taxes (federal withholding, state income taxes, social security, and
                Medicare). This information is on your paystub, so take the time to review it.

                Now let’s look at the costs associated with working. Examples include pet boarding, childcare, a
                professional wardrobe, and personal care (hair, nails, makeup, etc.) to look the part. This also
                includes if you are paying to go to lunches, happy hours, coffee and drinks with coworkers.

                Many new college grads discover their job has long hours and want to make their lives easier. Add in the
                cost of hiring out lawn care, housekeepers, grocery delivery and meal subscription services for
                convenience.

                Commuting! Maybe you moved to keep your rent low, but now you’re driving 30 miles each way. Multiply the
                distance you commute round-trip by the IRS mileage rate of $0.545 to account for gas, and maintenance on
                your vehicle.

                Now you can subtract out taxes, health insurance, and out-of-pocket costs associated with the job. You
                might be surprised at the reduced amount of spending power from your job.

                Let’s look at the time it takes to work. Include the time you spend in the office, plus the time you
                spend commuting, eating with coworkers, networking events, decompressing from the job, and in continuing
                education for your job.

                Take the annual salary minus the costs of working the job, and divide by the actual hours spent related
                to the job. This number is your real hourly wage. You might be surprised it’s around 25% – 33% of your
                quoted salary.

                Now you know the dollar amount you are trading for your life’s energy. The next time you look at a happy
                hour invitation, you’ll know how much of your life you’re trading for the experience.

            <h2>22. Save at least 10 – 15% of your income –</h2>
            <p>Nadia @ Speaking of Cents
                No matter how small your paycheck is, you should put some money away. This one habit will help you in
                every step of your life.

                Additionally, always live within your means. Trying to keep up with Joneses will only harm you and you
                will never achieve financial stability if you keep running after material things.

                Lastly, keep an eye out on where you can save money. Use student discounts, coupons and apply for
                cashback apps and reward programs to the brands you use the most. Applying for credit cards is necessary
                but don’t go applying for several at one time. Go slow and try to use your Debit Card most of the time.

                It helps to keep expenses under control as you would only spend the money that you actually have.

            <h2>23. Focus on living with a mindset of abundance… not a mindset of scarcity –</h2><br>
            <p>Mike @ Make Time Online
                Figure out what you want to do in the upcoming months and work out the budget to do this. Working out
                how much these fun activities costs means you will realize how much disposable income you have to spend
                on those random moments. This also helps if you can work out what investments you are saving money for.
                Figure out if it will help you to retire early and what you plan to do with your time when you can
                retire.

                It’s much easier to turn down a night out on the town or a Starbucks coffee if you know you are going to
                see your favorite band play or go on the holiday of your dreams soon. It’s also much easier to do it if
                you know that by the time you are 40 you could live the lifestyle you want every day.

                Your decisions are the same, but your mindset is completely different.

                Moving overseas and getting paid tax-free money with great benefits meant that I started having
                disposable income for the first time in my life. If I didn’t have this mindset I wouldn’t have been able
                to travel as much whilst putting money away for investments and the future.

                There will always be “something else” that you want to do but figuring out the most important things to
                you helps to live in a mindset of abundance rather than scarcity.

            <h2>24. Do everything you can to reduce your cost of education – </h2><br>
            <p>Cyrus @ Frugal Budgeter
                The cost of earning a college degree is wildly out of control. The total student loan debt in America
                has reached a staggering $1.5 trillion. Considering this, students should consider any way to lower the
                cost so they don’t have to take on a lot of student loan debt that could take decades to repay.

                One of the easiest ways to save money on earning a bachelor’s degree is to attend a community college
                for your first two years. Community colleges are usually just a fraction of the cost of four-year
                schools, and they often have all of the lower-division courses you’ll need for your degree.

                One of the great things about attending a community college is that if you qualify for the Pell Grant,
                the money you receive may cover all of your tuition, books, and other expenses. This means your first
                two years of college could be completely free.

                Another benefit of attending a community college is many of them have transfer agreements with four-year
                schools. This means if you graduate from a community college with a minimum GPA, you will be
                automatically accepted into one of these schools without having to take the SAT or ACT. This can be a
                backdoor strategy for getting into your dream school.

                Community colleges have many things going for them, and if you want to avoid going deep in debt to fund
                your degree, these great schools should be at the top of your list.

            <p>Carly @ Medicare Life Health
                If I could get all the money back that I spent the first 10 years after college on clothes, shoes,
                accessories, cars, Ikea furniture, and other durable goods, my retirement account might be twice as big.
                Add in my tab for eating out, and I might be able to retire today!

                There is a social momentum right now to embrace experiences and to let go of material possessions. Jump
                into this movement! It will not only help you save money and avoid credit card debt, but it will free
                you up to fully experience life. Minimalism and F.I.R.E. are two movements creating this momentum.

                Minimalism, or the art of living more with less, is one movement you can tap into for resources on
                letting go for your need for stuff. Focusing on buying higher quality over quantity and learning how to
                share resources are just two simple ways to get started.

                The F.I.R.E. movement is another community that can help you save your money. F.I.R.E. stands for
                Financial Independence Retire Early. The people in this movement have decided to increase their savings
                from the recommended 10-15% to upwards of 50-60% to retire earlier.

                The book that started my evaluation of my spending/saving was Vicki Robin’s “Your Money or Your Life.”
                This book has been a classic manual for early retirees with good reason. It will challenge you to
                completely reevaluate how you relate to money. Moreover, the book is most powerful when read at a
                younger age. You can read my quick review of Vicki’s book and a few other must-read books for people
                that want to retire sooner and with more money here.

                I will never regret trips with friends, concerts, or a fantastic meal. However, I do regret living in
                too fancy of apartments, upgrading my car every two years, and carelessly ingesting 20,000 lattes. These
                things did not make me happy. Looking back, I realize I never stopped to think about how I could use my
                money to make me truly happy. Here is your chance.

            <h2>26. Take advantage of the powerful force of compound interest – </h2><br>
            <p>Henry @ Bright Wealth Advisors
                Albert Einstein once said compound interest is, “the eighth wonder of the world.”

                It can’t be emphasized enough that time is the most important asset young professionals have on their
                side.

                Decide on a percentage of your income to save and commit to it. Professionals tend to get hung up on not
                being able to save 10-20% of their income early on (which they hear from money experts on the media) and
                decide to not save at all until the “time is right”.

                Unfortunately, what they will find is that the time is never right and procrastination is the most
                common reason people don’t have sufficient savings in retirement.

            <h2>Five Ways to Save Money as a Young Adult</h2><br>
            <p>
            <h3>1. Make a budget:</h3>You’ve heard it before. Creating and sticking to a budget is one of the best ways
            you can save money. Making a budget doesn’t mean you have to give up fun for the rest of your life. By
            creating a budget, you’ll be able to see where your money is going each month and allocate funds to saving,
            bills and entertainment. Try using MyMoney within online and mobile banking to get started.</p>
            <p><br>
            <h3>2. Don’t wait to save and invest:</h3>Saving and investing may seem like a challenge right now, but
            putting away just a few dollars a week can have a big impact. Use your budget to see how much money you can
            put into your savings account each month. And as for investing, if your employer offers a 401(k) account,
            U.S. News recommends deciding how much of your salary to contribute and increasing it as time goes on.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <h3>3. Save one-third of your income:</h3>If you aren’t sure how much you should save, U.S. News also
            recommends saving one-third of your income if you can. By saving $1 out of every $3 you earn, you are making
            it easier on yourself to survive future financial difficulties, such as layoffs, car repairs, home repairs,
            and other surprise expenses.</p><br>
            <p>
            <h3>4. Start an emergency fund:</h3>Another good way to save for financial hardship is to start an emergency
            fund. Investopedia recommends putting some money into a high-interest savings account, CD or money market
            account.</p><br>
            <p>
            <h3>5. Pay off your debt:</h3>While putting money into savings is a good way to prepare for your future, you
            should also be concerned about paying off your debt. You should be aggressive about paying off your debt and
            careful not to let your credit cards spiral out of control.</p><br>
