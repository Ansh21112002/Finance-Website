            </h1><br><br>
            <h2>What is Tax?</h2><br>
            <p>A tax is a mandatory fee or financial charge levied by any government on an individual or an organization
                to collect revenue for public works providing the best facilities and infrastructure. The collected fund
                is then used to fund different public expenditure programs. If one fails to pay the taxes or refuses to
                contribute towards it will invite serious implications under the pre-defined law.The Indian tax system
                is well structured and has a three-tier federal structure.( In federal systems, political authority is
                divided between two autonomous sets of governments, one national and the other subnational, both of
                which operate directly upon the people).</p><br>
            <h2>Types of Taxes</h2><br>
            <p>Be it an individual or any business/organization, all have to pay the respective taxes in various forms.
                These taxes are further subcategorized into direct and indirect taxes depending on the manner in which
                they are paid to the taxation authorities. Let us delve deeper into both types of tax in detail:</p><br>
            <h3>Direct Tax</h3>
            <p>The definition of direct tax is hidden in its name which implies that this tax is paid directly to the
                government by the taxpayer.
                The general examples of this type of tax in India are Income Tax and Wealth Tax.
                From the government’s perspective, estimating tax earnings from direct taxes is relatively easy as it
                bears a direct correlation to the income or wealth of the registered taxpayers.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Indirect Tax</h3>
            <p>Indirect taxes are slightly different from direct taxes and the collection method is also a bit
                different. These taxes are consumption-based that are applied to goods or services when they are bought
                and sold.
                The indirect tax payment is received by the government from the seller of goods/services.
                The seller, in turn, passes the tax on to the end-user i.e. buyer of the good/service.
                Thus the name indirect tax as the end-user of the good/service does not pay the tax directly to the
                government.
                Some general examples of indirect tax include sales tax, Goods and Services Tax (GST), Value Added Tax
                (VAT), etc.
            </p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Role of the Central and State Government</h2><br>
            <p>While direct taxes are levied on taxable income earned by individuals and corporate entities, the burden
                to deposit taxes is on the assesses(Person who pays tax) themselves. On the other hand, indirect taxes
                are levied on the sale and provision of goods and services respectively and the burden to collect and
                deposit taxes is on the sellers instead of the assessees(Person who pays tax) directly.</p><br>
            <p>The taxation system in India is such that the taxes are levied by the Central Government and the State
                Governments. Some minor taxes are also levied by the local authorities such as the Municipality and the
                Local Governments.</p><br>
            <p>Over the last few years, the Central and many State Governments have undertaken various policy reforms
                and process simplification towards great predictability, fairness and automation. This has consequently
                lead to India’s meteoric rise to the top 100 in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) ranking
                in 2019 as India jumps 79 positions from 142nd (2014) to 63rd (2019) in 'World Bank's Ease of Doing
                Business Ranking 2020'. The Goods & Services Tax (GST) reform is one such reform to ease the complex
                multiple indirect tax regime in India.

            <h2>Understanding Direct Tax</h2><br>
            <p>Direct taxes are imposed on corporate entities(the corporate entity is legally distinct from its members;
                it has legal personality and can hold property, sue and be sued in its own name as if it were a natural
                person) and individuals. These taxes cannot be transferred to others. For individual taxpayers like you,
                the most important type of Direct tax is the income tax. This tax is levied during each assessment year
                (1st April to 31st March). As per the Income Tax Act, 1961, it is mandatory for you to make income tax
                payments if your annual income is above the minimum exemption limit. You can get tax benefits under
                various sections of the Act. Before we talk about tax benefits, it is important for you to understand
                the income tax slab.</p><br>
            <h2>Understanding Indirect Tax: GST</h2><br>
            <p>GST is a comprehensive indirect tax levied on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods as well as
                services at the national level. It has replaced all indirect taxes levied on goods and services by the
                Central and State Governments.
                GST regime was implemented from 1st July 2017, and India has adopted the dual GST model in which both
                the Centre and States levy taxes:</p><br>

        <h2>What is Tax slab?</h2><br>
        <p>Individuals in India, earn an income in a diverse range. Therefore, it is important to levy a tax on you
            based on your income and if someone earns more, the tax percentage should be different. The Income Tax
            Act segregates the income range and charges different rates as per the segregation. The different groups
            are known as tax slabs. Your tax slab can vary not only based on your income but also your age. Every
            year during the Central Government’s Budget Session, amendments are made in the income-tax slabs.</p><br>
